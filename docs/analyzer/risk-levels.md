# Risk Levels

Analyzer results include a numeric score and a `riskLevel` label:

- `safe`
- `caution`
- `attention`
- `risky`
- `avoid`

These levels are derived from aggregated risk signals and their severities.

## Severities

Each risk signal has one severity:

- `info`
- `warning`
- `critical`

Prioritize remediation for `critical` signals first, then `warning`.
